1. Save your picture and mention its path in the main method as directed.
2. Build and run.

This project can also be used for other binary classifications too.
1. Create a NeuralNetwork object.
2. Train the neural network. ->
   For example you want to classify dogs. Save many dog and non-dog pictures in the directory. Mention their path in the data
   string and set their labels accordingly(Y array). 1 if dog, 0 if non-dog.
3. Set number of iterations and learning_rate (Like : 1000, 0.01)
   (Smaller learning rate and larger number of iterations creates an accurate neural network but slow)
4. Your neural net is ready, enjoy.

NB. This is just a logistic regression model. So accuracy will be at most 70-80%.
